I began as a software engineer at **IBM Watson** in New York City (2016–2023), then wandered into academia as a research assistant at **NYU** (2023–2024). Eventually I packed my bags and moved ~7,800 miles to India (and no, not because of Trump 😅). Now you’ll find me in Bengaluru as an **Entrepreneur-in-Residence at Evam Labs**.  

What do I actually do here? Depends on the day. I **try** to write research papers, code when the mood strikes, keep an eye on competitors, and generally hover at the intersection of **multimodal AI** and **creativity** — with a side hustle in overthinking.  

So when people ask, *“What do you do?”* my answer is usually:  
👉 *“I don’t know… it’s somewhere between writing, coding, and staring into the void (or the 37 tabs on my laptop) until an idea appears.”*
