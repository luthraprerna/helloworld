👋 **Hi, I'm Prerna.** I work where AI, research, product, and creativity intersect — turning ideas into systems and frameworks that help people and organizations see the world differently. I thrive on out-of-the-box approaches that uncover hidden patterns, spark fresh insights, and challenge conventional thinking.

I began as a software engineer at **IBM Watson** in New York City (2016–2023), then wandered into academia as a researcher at **New York University** (2023–2024). Eventually I packed my bags and moved ~7,800 miles to India (and no, not because of Trump 😅). Now you’ll find me in Bengaluru as an **Entrepreneur-in-Residence at Evam Labs**.
