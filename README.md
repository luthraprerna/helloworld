# Personal Homepage (GitHub Pages + Jekyll)

This is a minimal, clean personal site using **Jekyll** with the built-in **minima** theme.  
Works out of the box on GitHub Pages — no build steps required.

## Quick deploy
1. Create a public repo named `your-username.github.io` (replace with your GitHub username).
2. Upload these files to that repo's `main` branch.
3. In **Settings → Pages**, set **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**, pick **main** and **/** (root).
4. Open `https://your-username.github.io`.

## Customize
- Edit `_config.yml` (name, social links).
- Update `index.md`, `about.md`, and `projects.md`.
- Add blog posts in `_posts/` as `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.
